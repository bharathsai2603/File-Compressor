# Huffman Encoding and Compression

This C++ project implements Huffman encoding, a popular compression algorithm that efficiently reduces the size of files by encoding frequently occurring characters with shorter binary codes. Huffman encoding is widely used in data compression techniques due to its ability to minimize the overall size of encoded data while maintaining lossless compression.

## Overview

This project consists of:

- Building a Huffman tree from character frequencies in the input file.
- Generating Huffman codes for each character based on their frequency.
- Compressing the input file using the generated codes.
- Decompressing the compressed file to verify the accuracy of the encoding process.
- Calculating the compression ratio to measure effectiveness.

## Features

- **Huffman Tree Construction**: Builds a binary tree where characters with higher frequency have shorter paths, resulting in smaller encoded file sizes.
- **Encoding and Decoding**: Compresses the original file using the Huffman codes and then decompresses it back to its original content.
- **Compression Ratio Calculation**: Outputs the file size before and after compression, showing the effectiveness of Huffman encoding.
- **Binary File Writing**: Writes compressed data in binary format, allowing for further file size reduction.

## How It Works

1. **Read the Input File**: The program reads characters from `input.txt` and counts the frequency of each character.
2. **Construct the Huffman Tree**: Based on character frequencies, a Huffman tree is built, where each character is represented as a leaf node. Characters with higher frequencies are assigned shorter codes.
3. **Generate Huffman Codes**: Each character is assigned a unique binary code, with more frequent characters receiving shorter codes.
4. **File Compression**: The input file is encoded using the generated Huffman codes, and the compressed output is written to `output.txt`.
5. **File Decompression**: The compressed file is read, and the data is decoded using the Huffman tree to restore the original file content, saved as `output1.txt`.
6. **Calculate Compression Ratio**: The program calculates and prints the original file size, compressed file size, and the resulting compression ratio.

## File Structure

- **input.txt**: The input file containing text to be compressed.
- **output.txt**: The compressed file generated by the program.
- **output1.txt**: The decompressed file, used to verify the integrity of the compression and decompression process.

## Functions Overview

### Data Structures
- **MinHeapNode**: Represents a node in the Huffman tree.
- **MinHeap**: Min-heap structure to assist in constructing the Huffman tree.

### Core Functions
- `newNode`: Creates a new Huffman tree node.
- `createMinHeap`: Initializes a min-heap for frequency data.
- `minHeapify`, `extractMin`, `insertMinHeap`, `buildMinHeap`: Maintain the min-heap structure.
- `buildHuffmanTree`: Constructs the Huffman tree by combining nodes with the smallest frequencies.
- `HuffmanTraverse`: Traverses the Huffman tree to assign binary codes to each character.
- `binaryconvert`: Converts characters to binary format for storage in `output.txt`.

## Example Output

Upon running the program, the output will show the following details:

```plaintext
Input File Size : <size> bytes
Compressed File Size : <size> bytes
Compression Ratio : <ratio>
Final Output File Size : <size> bytes
